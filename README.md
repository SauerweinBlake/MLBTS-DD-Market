# MLB The Show 2023 Market Data Forecasting (WIP)
MLB The Show 2023's Diamond Dynasty game mode is one that I play every year and one thing that has always been interesting about it is the market. The market system that MLB The Show uses is vastly different from other games with the same conceptual game mode as Diamond Dynasty.

## How MLB The Show's Market Works
For MLB The Show's Market, there is 1 card listed with an array of prices that users such as I have listed them for. For example if you are looking to buy a Mike Trout Live Series Card, there is only 1 of that specific card listed, but for a various amount of prices, that is displayed in a sort of table format as shown below

| Sell Now Price | Buy Now Price |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| 150,000        | 305,000       |
| 146,000        | 310,000       |
| 145,000        | 315,000       |
| 144,000        | 316,000       |
| 140,000        | 317,000       |
| 138,000        | 318,000       |
| 133,000        | 325,000       |
| 132,000        | 327,000       |

## How Other Sports Game's Markets Work
In other sports games, in our example case here we will look at Madden by EA Sports, the market is structured differently. When you look for a card, for instance a Tom Brady card, there will be 100s of the same Tom Brady card listed at different buy it now price points. This can get weird, for example below, we have 5 Tom Brady cards all listed around 100,000 with 2 outliers, but the question is, is the 25,000 cost Tom Brady an outlier? Or is that actually a really good price, it's just the other well priced ones have been purchased as well?

Tom Brady   Buy Now: 100,000
Tom Brady   Buy Now: 200,000
Tom Brady   Buy Now: 25,000
Tom Brady   Buy Now: 125,000
Tom Brady   Buy Now: 130,000

## What's the Difference
The feature that Madden does not have here that MLB The Show does is the "Sell Now Price". There is no listings of users on Madden offering their in-game currency to buy that card, it is only the user's with the card offering to sell it at the price point they set. You must either pay that price that user holding the card is selling it at or find another way to get that card. This is what can help a user in navigating the market. In our Tom Brady example. If you saw all those prices listed, BUT then saw sell now prices for Tom Brady around the 20,000 range you would know that the 25,000 Tom Brady is well-priced and the other 4 are outliers, but without that, you have no clue. The feature of having both sell now and buy now prices for Diamond Dynasty in MLB The Show is a really nice feature and allows for, in my opinion, there to be a lot more control, supply and demand, and information within MLB The Show.

#### Control
I believe that there is more control within this market type as the users without the card get to set what they think the card is worth. Yeah the person holding the card can still list it for 5 times more than what people are asking and hope that it gets sold, but in reality the user is going to have to be more reasonable.

#### Supply and Demand
Supply and Demand is good for game modes like Diamond Dynasty. It allows for some of those lower tier cards to have a much higher price. For instance, at the beginning of the real MLB season there are some young prospects that get called up, so MLB The Show adds their card to Diamond Dynasty and since they were added mid-game the players are more rare and can have a high demand, but low supply which makes getting them really valuable and can snag you a lot of Stubs - the in-game currency for MLB The Show

#### Information
Finally, this market setup provides new users with much more information. For instance, overalls are typically pretty easy to base a choice of whether or not a player is good or not. You are 100% of the time going to play a 95 overall right fielder over a 75 overall right fielder. But what about a 90 overall right fielder? Is he worth considering? And that is something you can kind of use the market to help judge. a 95 overall player is typically going to be more expensive, but if you have a 90 overall player with high demand and a high price point, there's got to be something to that right? There's has to be something about that card that makes him play like a 95 overall and you can get that sort of information by looking at the Diamond Dynasty market due to the way it has been structured.
